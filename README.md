# Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Welcome to this repository. Here you can find a brief set of divide and conquer algorithms. I hope you can find what you searched or if not that at least some inspiration for your projects etc.

## What is Divide and Conquer?
In divide-and-conquer, we solve problems recursively, applying certain steps at each level of the recursion. What are said steps?

* **Divide** a problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
* **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively (if the subproblems reached a certain - small enough - size, solve the subproblems straightforward)
* **Combine** the solutions to the subproblems to the solution of the original problem
