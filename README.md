# Divide and Conquer Algorithms</h1>
Welcome to this repository. Here you can find a brief set of divide and conquer algorithms. I hope you can find what you searched for and if not that you at least found some inspiration for your (future) projects.

You can find the implementation of the algoririthms that I refer to in the following in the src folder of this repository. The implementation will be in Python 3 for now. I optimized it for a pythonic way of code, yet I hope that my comments are enough for you to understand the implementation.

Thank you and happy coding!

## What is Divide and Conquer?
In divide-and-conquer, we solve problems recursively, applying certain steps at each level of the recursion. What are said steps?

* **Divide** a problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
* **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively (if the subproblems reached a certain - small enough - size, solve the subproblems straightforward)
* **Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solution of the original problem

If that isn't quite the answer to you, here I explain it in a little more detail.


## Recurrences

* **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively (if the subproblems reached a certain - small enough - size, solve the subproblems straightforward)
* **Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solution of the original problem
